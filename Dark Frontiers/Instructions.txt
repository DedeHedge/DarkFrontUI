- Included with this Update, i added a file that contains the Dark Frontiers's version of the Snowy Ouranos Map UI. 

To put it in game simply choose from the "dark" or "uiedit" folder and drag it all the way into the "ui" folder,
 
then replace the current file inside! i would've manually supported it, but it would've taken up more space then needed. 

Thanks For Playing Dark Frontiers, and stay tuned for the next update!
